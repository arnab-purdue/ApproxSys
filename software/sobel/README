MATLAB:full_system/sobel_edge/
rgb2grayscale_cheader.m -> convert png/jpg image to grayscale and then to c with 'subsampling'
sobel_scaledown_recreate.m -> reconstruct  *.m file generated from sobel app in c to the final edge detected image 

C:
sobelrnr.c - > sobel file where we need to change to the appropriate header file and the appropriate output file name
	       skipx; skipy needs to be changed for varying computational approximation (gbmin and gbmax are ketp constant)
error_sobel.c -> introduces dram error in the header file to be segmented - output the appropriate file
