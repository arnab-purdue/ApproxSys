MATLAB:full_system/kmeans_img_seg/
rgb_2c.m -> cover png/jpg image to rgb format for kmeans with 'subsampling'
imageseg.m -> reconstruct segmented *.m file generated from c to the image with error characteristics

C:
kmeans2.c - > kmeans file where we need to change to the appropriate header file and the appropriate output file name
error_kmeans.c -> introduces dram error in the header file to be segmented

Misc: 
Computational approximations were performed by either changing the total number of iterations or the presence of ctrl (uncomment to 1)
