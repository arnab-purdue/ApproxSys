Readme file for PGM code 
*********************************


This code is intended to allow the user to save and write
PGM files to and from two dimensional arrays.  

**To use this code:**
	1. copy all the files in the PGM directory to your home 
	   directory.

	2. issue the command:

	   make -f makePGM

	3. pgmDemo is an executable file demonstrating read, write and
	   simple file manipulation and synthesis routines for PGM
	   files.

	4. PGM.h contains all the default settings including the
	   maximum dimensions of the array (MAXROWS and MAXCOLS).

                               ***

Portable Bit Maps (PBM's) come in three main varieties:

	1. Binary formats (type P1(char) and P4(binary))-"PBM"
	2. Greyscale formats (P2(char) and P5(binary))-"PGM"
	    ("Portable Greyscale Maps")
	3. Colour Formats (P3(char) and P6(binary))-"PPM"
	    ("Portable Pixmaps")

The code included here is for use with the P2 and P5 formats
for input, and writes P5 (binary) images.

A short list of files and what they're for:

    makePGM - the makefile for the files below

    pgmDemo - (low rent) user interface for trying the routines
      a number of simple manipulations are offered.  The program 
      automatically displays the resulting image if the request is handled
      adequately.

    demopgm.c demopgm.h - C code for the user interface	

    iroutines.c iroutines.h - simple image manipulation routines.	

    PGM.c PGM.h -  C functions to save and read PGM's to a 2D array
	           PGM.h contains all default constants.
